        Lyrics:
    </h4>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(135, 171, 222); border: 2%; border-radius: 5%; margin: 0%; padding: auto; text-size-adjust: 1rem;"> 
    <p style="margin: 1.2rem; padding: auto; padding-top: 1.2rem; -webkit-text-fill-color: rgb(18, 13, 13); text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold;">
     I held her close to me<br>
    'Cause I know she breaks so easily<br>
     And then I told her<br>
     But I knew no matter how I tried to console her<br>
     She'd just do the best she could<br>
     But there are times the best is no damn good<br>
     And no matter how you try to be kind<br>
     There's always still a part of you you leave behind<br>
     When it falls apart<br>
     There's no easy way to break somebody's heart<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1rem; padding: auto; -webkit-text-fill-color: rgb(12, 7, 7); text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold;">
     I lied and told her she'd be fine<br>
     Though we both knew it was just a line<br>
     I had to do it<br>
    'Cause I'd've said anything to help me get through it<br>
     Then she reached out for my hand<br>
     And her simple touch was more than I could stand<br>
     And I had to turn away<br>
    'Cause I knew all the hurt<br>
     That she was feeling I was feeling too<br>
    'Cause when it falls apart<br>
     There's no easy way to break somebody's heart<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1rem; padding: auto; -webkit-text-fill-color: rgb(11, 6, 6); text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold;">
     She could've gotten angry<br>
     And made me feel like a guilty child<br>
     But I realized that never was her style<br>
     I wanted her to hurt me<br>
     And not treat me like a friend<br>
     I wanted her to say there'd be someday<br>
     I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her back again<br>
     But she acted like a lady 'til the end<br>
     Oh, what a lady<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1rem; padding: auto; -webkit-text-fill-color: rgb(8, 4, 4); text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold;">
     I thought that she'd break down<br>
     But she smiled at me and never made a sound<br>
     And I guess she understood in her way<br>
    'Cause her silence told me everything she could not say<br>
     When it falls apart<br>
     Well there's just no easy way<br>
     There's just no easy way<br>
     There's no easy way to break somebody's heart <br>
    </p>
