        There's no Easy Way <br>

       <p style="border: 0cqb;">I held her close to me <br>
       'Cause I know she breaks so easily <br>
        And then I told her<br>
        But I knew no matter how I tried to console her<br>
        She'd just do the best she could<br>
        But there are times the best is no damn good<br>
        And no matter how you try to be kind<br>
        There's always still a part of you you leave behind<br>
        When it falls apart<br>
        There's no easy way to break somebody's heart<br><p>
      
        <p style="border: 0cqb;">I lied and told her she'd be fine <br>
        Though we both knew it was just a line<br>
        I had to do it<br>
        'Cause I'd've said anything to help me get through it</p>
   

        <p style="border: 0cqb;">Then she reached out for my hand<br>
        And her simple touch was more than I could stand<br>
        And I had to turn away<br>
        'Cause I knew all the hurt<br>
        That she was feeling I was feeling too<br>
        'Cause when it falls apart<br>
        There's no easy way to break somebody's heart<br></p>


        <p style="border: 0cqb;">She could've gotten angry<br>
        And made me feel like a guilty child<br>
        But I realized that never was her style<br>
        I wanted her to hurt me<br>
        And not treat me like a friend<br>
        I wanted her to say there'd be someday<br>
        I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her back again<br>
        But she acted like a lady 'til the end<br></p>

        Oh, what a lady</br>

        <p style="border: 0cqb;">I thought that she'd break down<br>
        But she smiled at me and never made a sound<br>
        And I guess she understood in her way<br>
        'Cause her silence told me everything she could not say<br>
        When it falls apart<br>
        Well there's just no easy way<br>
        There's just no easy way<br>
        There's no easy way to break somebody's heart.. <br></p>
